It has four buttons, an RGB LED, and an FPGA that is compatible with a fully open source chain and capable of running a RISC-V core. Fomu comes in a custom plastic enclosure that slots perfectly into a USB Type-A port.
Python, RISC-V, FPGA, All Open Fomu has Python With 128 kilobytes of RAM and a large amount of storage, Fomu is powerful enough to run Python natively.</description></item></channel></rss>
