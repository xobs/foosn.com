**Farpatch** is a wireless debugger, capable of programming, debugging, and interacting with a wide range of microcontrollers. Powered by the BlackMagic debug software, Farpatch supports inspecting memory, single-stepping code, and adding breakpoints to your project. You don’t need to install any drivers, just join Farpatch to your wireless network, or let it run in AP mode if you’re not near an access point.

Farpatch can also draw power from your board, supports board voltages of 1.8 - 5 V, and will adjust itself accordingly.
